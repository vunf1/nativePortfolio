    <h2 >Interests</h2>

    <p>Apart from being a programmer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors with my friends. My interests are all around computers, I love computer since I was a little boy I grow up seeing the computer evolution, in all terms, in front of my eyes and that was and still wonderful/prodigious to watch, I started to self-study some basic computer concepts when I was 10 years old just for the pleasure of learning something about the machine that was in front of me and I was learning something that wasn’t in school parameters to teach, at the time I saw my logic/understanding ability take action, in the area of programming, I have a motto that I like that is “Think&Execute”, I develop a relationship very strong with it, not in terms of addiction but in terms of the need to learn more and more, in a healthy way always.<br>I’m comfortable in terms of programming I got a good workflow, excellent teamwork experience, achieved while leading university projects (first grade all projects as a group) , I’m passionate about how objects move, how elements collided and how variables make reliable equations. Computers have always fascinated me, all I know I learn in front of a computer searching and learning, I never try to copy the knowledge of others but rather to learn how to accomplish the task.</p>
